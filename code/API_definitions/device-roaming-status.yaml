  title: Device Roaming Status
  description: |
    This API provides the API consumer with the ability to query device roaming Status

    # Introduction

    ## Roaming Status
    API consumer is able to verify whether a certain user device is in roaming situation (or not).

    The verification of the roaming situation depends on the network's ability. Additionally to the roaming status, when the device is in roaming situation, visited country information could be returned in the response.

    ## Possible Use-Cases
    Roaming status verification could be useful in scenario such as (not exhaustive):
      - For regulatory reasons, where a customer may need to be within a certain jurisdiction, or out with others, in order for transactions to be authorized
      - For security / fraud reasons, to establish that a customer is located where they claim to be
      - For service delivery reasons, to ensure that the customer has access to particular service, and will not incur roaming charges in accessing them

    ## Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.

        At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options must be provided: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device. Where more than one device identifier is provided, only one identifier will be selected by the implementation and this choice indicated to the API consumer in the session creation response.

        Note: Network Access Identifier is defined for future use and will not be supported with this version of the API.

    * **Roaming** : Roaming status - `true`, if device is in roaming situation - `false` else.

    * **Country** : Country code and name - visited country information, provided if the device is in roaming situation.

    * **LastStatusTime** : The time when the status was last confirmed to be correct. An older status is more likely to now be incorrect.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capabilities:

    ## Device roaming situation

    The endpoint `POST /retrieve` allows to get roaming status and country information (if device in roaming situation) synchronously.

    # Further info and support

    ## Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ### Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    ## Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    ## Multi-SIM scenario handling

    In multi-SIM scenarios where more than one mobile device is associated with a phone number (e.g. a smartphone with an associated smartwatch), it might not be possible to uniquely identify the device for which the roaming status should be returned from that phone number. If the phone number is used as the device identifier when querying in a multi-SIM scenario, the API may:
    - respond with an error, or
    - return a combined roaming status for the multi-SIM group as a whole, or
    - return the roaming status for a single device in the multi-SIM group, which may not be the intended device.

    Possible solutions in such a scenario include:
    - Using the authorisation code flow to obtain an access token, which will automatically identify the intended device
    - Identifying the intended device from a unique identifier for that device, such as its source IP address and port
    - Check with the SIM provider whether a unique "secondary" phone number is already associated with each device, and use the secondary phone number to identify the intended device if available.

    ## Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    DeviceResponse:
      description: |
        An identifier for the end-user equipment able to connect to the network that the response refers to. This parameter is only returned when the API consumer includes the `device` parameter in their request (i.e. they are using a two-legged access token), and is relevant when more than one device identifier is specified, as only one of those device identifiers is allowed in the response.

        If the API consumer provides more than one device identifier in their request, the API provider must return a single identifier which is the one they are using to fulfil the request, even if the identifiers do not match the same device. API provider does not perform any logic to validate/correlate that the indicated device identifiers match the same device. No error should be returned if the identifiers are otherwise valid to prevent API consumers correlating different identifiers with a given end user.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
