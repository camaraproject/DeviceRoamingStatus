@Device_Roaming_Status
Feature: CAMARA Device Roaming Status API, v1.1.0-rc.2 - Operation getRoamingStatus
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, networkAccessIdentifier, ipv4Address, ipv6Address
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * A device object which roaming status is known by the network when connected.
  # * The known roaming status of the testing device
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specifies in device-roaming-status.yaml
